The guide is broken down into 9 steps which appear in the sidebar to the right

## Warning

<strong  style="color: red">This wiki is intended for experienced linux users and NOT advisable for new linux users. It is recommended that you are familiar with these concepts of the linux system before starting:</strong>
- The commandline
- File and folder movement through commandline
- File and folder permissions and ownership
- File and folder structure of linux
- File editing from the commandline (nano, vim, or anything else)

**Your configuration and the one in this wiki can, and will be different.** Therefore,***take all the steps with a grain of salt and do not blindly copy-paste the values*** that are written in various configuration files showed.

**Last warning, your GPU has to support UEFI, and so does your system. Be sure to have installed your distro with UEFI, otherwise you might have to do some more workarounds that are not explained in this guide.**

If you have issues with your VM, go to the FAQ page to start troubleshooting your issue(s)

To start the guide, head over to [step 1](1\)-Preparations).

Have fun, and good luck!
